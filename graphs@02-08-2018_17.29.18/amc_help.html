Data Exchange Charts</h1></center>
The Data Exchange Chart displays the overall flow of application-layer
data between tiers, from the start of the recorded data exchange (far left)
to the end (far right).
<p>A chart colors each application-message arrow and application-message-group
bar by the amount of application-layer data stored in the corresponding
message(s), as indicated by the "Application Payload Size" legend beneath
the chart. The amount of color in each bar indicates the proportion of
packets that fall into each application-payload size category, as seen
in the following diagram.
