			AppDoctor Diagnosis</h1>
		The AppDoctor Diagnosis window identifies various types of bottlenecks and 
		potential bottlenecks in your network and/or application. Refer to the 
		following sections for possible causes and recommended solutions for each type 
		of bottleneck.
		<br>
		&nbsp;
		<h3>
			<a NAME="processing_delay"></a>Processing Delay Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		Processing on this tier is contributing significantly to the application 
		response time.
		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		Processing delay is due to file I/O, CPU processing, memory access, etc.
		<br>
		The numeric value represents tier processing delay as a percentage of the total 
		application response time.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Increase the processing speed and capabilities of the tier. <blockquote>a) 
			Increase physical memory, if a tier frequently uses virtual memory (pages).
			<br>
			b) Increase CPU speed and/or number, if a tier frequently utilizes 100% of its 
			CPUs.
			<br>
			c) Add faster disks, if a tier frequently accesses disks. <blockquote>o Many small 
				read/writes will benefit from faster disk seek times.
				<br>
				o Many large read/writes will benefit from faster disk throughput.</blockquote>
		</blockquote>2) Improve the processing efficiency of the application programs. <blockquote>a) 
			For database applications: <blockquote>o Index fields that are frequently queried.
				<br>
				o Redesign database queries to reduce database load.
				<br>
				o Avoid sending records across the network one at a time, when a set is 
				transferred.</blockquote>b) For all applications: <blockquote>o Reduce the 
				number of allowed simultaneous connections to limit the load on the tier.
				<br>
				o Profile the program to determine execution bottlenecks.</blockquote></blockquote>
		3) Reduce the load on this tier by sharing its work with additional machines.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="protocol_overhead"></a>Protocol Overhead Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		Large amounts of protocol overhead are increasing the utilization of your 
		network.
		<h4>
			Explanations</h4>
		Protocol headers add overhead to each application message. Protocols also send 
		packets that have no application data (such as TCP acknowledgement packets). 
		This overhead can introduce delays by increasing congestion in the network; 
		these delays can be especially significant if you are sending a large number of 
		small application messages.
		<br>
		The numeric value represents the percentage of total data that is protocol 
		overhead.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		Make your application send fewer, larger application messages. This will 
		utilize network resources more efficiently.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="chattiness"></a>Chattiness Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The application is sending many small requests and responses. Many small 
		requests and responses make inefficient use of tier and network resources.
		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		The data sent per application turn is small.&nbsp; This may cause significant 
		network delay. Additionally, a significant portion of application processing 
		time can be spent processing requests and responses.
		<br>
		If you have a "Chattiness" bottleneck without a "Network Cost of Chattiness" 
		bottleneck, this means that <blockquote>o The application is not incurring 
			significant network delays due to chattiness;
			<br>
			o The application may be incurring significant processing delays due to 
			overhead associated with handling many small application requests/responses;
			<br>
			o The application's "Network Cost of Chattiness" could dramatically increase in 
			a higher-latency network.</blockquote>The numeric value is the number of 
		application bytes per application turn.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		Make your application send fewer, larger application messages. This will 
		utilize network and tier resources more efficiently.&nbsp; For example, a 
		database application should avoid sending groups of records across the network 
		one record at a time.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="network_cost_of_chattiness"></a>Network Cost of Chattiness Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The application is incurring significant networking delays due to many 
		application turns.
		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		Each time the conversation changes direction (an "application turn"), the 
		packets incur a network delay while traversing the network.&nbsp; Mildly chatty 
		applications suffer over high-latency networks (like WANs), while very chatty 
		applications can suffer even over low-latency networks (like LANs).
		<br>
		Interactive applications (such as telnet) tend to be chattier than 
		non-interactive applications.
		<br>
		The numeric value is the total network delay incurred as a result of 
		application turns, represented as a percentage of the overall application 
		response time.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Make your application send fewer, larger application messages. This will 
		utilize network and tier resources more efficiently.&nbsp; For example, a 
		database application should avoid sending groups of records across the network 
		one record at a time.
		<br>
		2) Consider decreasing the network latency between chatty tiers: <blockquote>a) If 
			the application has a "Transmission Delay" bottleneck between the chatty tiers, 
			increasing the transmission speed between those tiers may help.
			<br>
			b) If the application has a "Propagation Delay" bottleneck between the chatty 
			tiers, decreasing the propagation delay between those tiers may help.</blockquote>
		<h3>
			<a NAME="propagation_delay"></a>Propagation Delay Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The application is experiencing a significant bottleneck due to the time it 
		takes packets to propagate across the network.
		<br>
		Explanation
		<br>
		Each time the application conversation changes direction (an "application 
		turn"), the application waits for packets to propagate across the 
		network.&nbsp; Propagation delay is typically a function of the speed of light 
		and the distance traveled.&nbsp; Devices latencies also add to propagation 
		delays.
		<br>
		The numeric value is the total delay incurred due to propagation, represented 
		as a percentage of the overall application response time.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Consider moving the affected tiers physically closer together.
		<br>
		2) If the application has a "Chattiness" bottleneck, addressing the 
		application's chattiness may significantly improve application response time.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="transmission_delay"></a>Transmission Delay Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The application is experiencing a significant bottleneck due to the 
		transmission speed.
		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		A packet's transmission delay is a function of the size of the packet.&nbsp; 
		Lower transmission speeds cause larger delays.
		<br>
		The numeric value represents the total delay incurred due to transmission 
		speed, as a percentage of the overall application response time.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Consider using faster links.
		<br>
		2) Consider sending less data.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="protocol_delay"></a>Protocol Delay Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The application is experiencing a significant bottleneck due to protocol 
		effects.
		<h4>
			Explanations</h4>
		Network protocols (such as TCP) frequently perform flow control, congestion 
		control, etc. which may throttle the rate at which applications send 
		data.&nbsp; Other protocol effects that can impact application performance 
		include retransmissions and collisions.
		<br>
		The numeric value is the total delay incurred due to protocol effects, 
		represented as a percentage of the overall application response time.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Check for evidence of problems such as collisions at the MAC layer or 
		retransmissions at the transport layer.
		<br>
		2) If the application is using TCP: <blockquote>a) Check to see if the application 
			is using Nagle's Algorithm. <blockquote>o Applications can disable Nagle's 
				Algorithm with a system call such as "setsockopt(?, TCP_NODELAY,?)"
				<br>
				o Nagle's Algorithm can frequently be disabled for an entire tier.</blockquote>
			b) Check to see if "TCP Windowing" is reported as a bottleneck.</blockquote>
		<h3>
			<a NAME="congestion_delay"></a>Congestion Delay Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The application is experiencing a significant bottleneck due to congestion 
		effects.
		<h4>
			Explanations</h4>
		If high amounts of network traffic result in links that are heavily utilized 
		(regardless of the available bandwidth on the link), the network will induce a 
		variable queuing delay. This delay might throttle the rate at which 
		applications send data. Other congestion effects that can affect application 
		performance include retransmissions and collisions.
		<br>
		The numeric value is the total delay incurred due to congestion effects, 
		represented as a percentage of the overall application response time
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Use faster links.
		<br>
		2) Send less data.
		<br>
		3) Reschedule the application to occur off-hours, or when there is less 
		traffic.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="connection_resets"></a>Connection Resets Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The application is experiencing an excessive number of connection resets.
		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		Connection resets can occur for a variety of reasons, including: <blockquote>1)&nbsp; 
			An application is closing a connection.
			<br>
			2)&nbsp; Delayed or duplicate connection control packets are received.
			<br>
			3)&nbsp; An application is attempting to open a connection on a port where no 
			application is listening.</blockquote>Note, however, that some protocols 
		such as HTTP frequently have many connection resets, which is normal.
		<br>
		The numeric value is the total number of connection resets.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		Repeat the experiment wherein you captured application traffic. Import the new 
		packet trace into ACE to determine if connection resets are typical.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="retransmissions"></a>Retransmissions Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		Retransmissions are significantly affecting application response times.
		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		Transport protocols such as TCP will retransmit packets if packets are lost or 
		excessively delayed.&nbsp; This leads to longer application response times 
		because: <blockquote>1)&nbsp; Data must be transmitted more than once.
			<br>
			2) When TCP observes packet loss, it infers that the network is 
			congested.&nbsp; This causes TCP to reduce the rate at which applications can 
			send traffic. Retransmissions increase the likelihood of "TCP Windowing" 
			bottlenecks because retransmissions cause TCP to shrink the Congestion Control 
			Window.</blockquote>Lossy channels such as Frame Relay or ATM can allow 
		applications to "burst" above sustainable data transmission rates.&nbsp; These 
		"bursts" allow greater data rates, but packets within a burst are more likely 
		to be dropped.
		<br>
		The numeric value represents the percentage of packets that were retransmitted.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Capture another trace of your application traffic and re-import it into 
		ACE.&nbsp; This can help you determine if retransmissions are typical.
		<br>
		2) Reduce the likelyhood of congestion in the network by increasing network 
		capacity.&nbsp; If possible, you may want to determine where packet losses are 
		occurring.
		<br>
		3) Enable TCP extensions (such as Selective Acknowledgements and Fast 
		Retransmit/Fast Recovery) which increase TCP's ability to cope with packet loss 
		and retransmissions.&nbsp; The method of enabling these TCP extensions varies 
		according to your operating system, and you may need to upgrade your operating 
		system version.
		<br>
		4) If you are using Frame Relay and/or ATM, decrease the "lossiness" by 
		enabling traffic shaping. Traffic shaping keeps data transmission rates within 
		the sustainable level, which means packets are less likely to be dropped. 
		Contact your service provider and/or vendor for additional information.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="out_of_seq"></a>Out of Sequence Packets</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		Many packets are being received out of order. This may be caused by packet loss 
		and retransmissions.
		<h4>
			Explanation and Suggestions</h4>
		Same as <a href="#retransmissions">retransmissions</a>.
		<h3>
			<a NAME="tcp_windowing"></a>TCP Windowing Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		TCP Windowing is a significant bottleneck for data sent between host A and host 
		B. TCP is reducing the rate at which the application can sending data because 
		of congestion control, flow control, send window sizes, and/or receive window 
		sizes.
		<br>
		Explanation
		<br>
		When an application is sending bulk data over a high-bandwidth and high- 
		latency network, TCP window sizes must be large enough to permit TCP to send 
		many packets in a row without having to wait for TCP ACKs.&nbsp; TCP will only 
		send data if the amount of sent-but-not-yet-acknowledged data is less than the 
		minimum of the congestion control window, sender window, and receiver window 
		sizes. <blockquote>o The sender and receiver windows have default sizes, which can 
			be overridden by an application.
			<br>
			o The congestion control window is dynamically sized by TCP in response to 
			retransmissions and other factors.
			<br>
			o TCP will be forced to wait for acknowledgments if any windows are less than 
			the "bandwidth-delay product". The bandwidth-delay product is 2 x Bandwidth x 
			Propagation Delay.
			<br>
			o See TCP/IP Illustrated, Vol. 1 by Richard Stevens for additional 
			explanations.</blockquote>The numeric value is the amount of 
		bandwidth-delay product used by the TCP connection.
		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		Make sure the application is using windows which are larger than the 
		bandwidth-delay product. The maximum amount of sent-but-not-yet-acknowledged 
		data from the source to the destination host appears as the AppDoctor statistic 
		Max Unacknowledged Data Sent.&nbsp; It is likely that one of the windows is 
		equal to the AppDoctor statistic Max Unacknowledged Data Sent. <blockquote>1) Check 
			the receive window size for the destination host. <blockquote>a) This is visible in 
				the TCP protocol decode as WIN=XXXX.
				<br>
				b) If this is approximately equal to Max Unacknowledged Data Sent, then the 
				receive window is likely the bottleneck. <blockquote>o Applications can set the 
					receive window size with a system call such as "setsockopt (?, SO_RCVBUF,?)"
					<br>
					o The default receive window size can frequently be set for an entire tier.</blockquote>
			</blockquote>2) If there are many TCP retransmissions, then the congestion 
			control window may be the bottleneck. You can decrease the negative effects of 
			retransmissions by enabling TCP extensions such as Fast Retransmit/Fast 
			Recovery and Selective Acknowledgments. The method of enabling these TCP 
			extensions varies according to your operating system, and you may need to 
			upgrade your operating system version.
			<p>3) If receive window and retransmissions do not seem to be the bottleneck, try 
				increasing the send window size for the source host. <blockquote>a) Applications 
					can set the send window size with a system call such as "setsockopt (?, 
					SO_SNDBUF,?)"
					<br>
					b) The default receive window size can frequently be set for an entire tier.</blockquote>
		</blockquote>
		
		<h3>
			<a NAME="tcp_frozen_window"></a>TCP Frozen Window Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		The advertised TCP Receive Window has dropped to a value smaller than the Maximum 
		Segment Size (MSS). This is affecting your application response time.

		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		The advertised TCP Receive Window has dropped to a value smaller than
		the MSS. When this occurs, the sender cannot send any data until the 
		receive window is one MSS or larger.
		<br><br>
		To determine if the receive window has become larger, the sending side
		periodically sends one-byte probe packets. These contents of these
		probe packets depends on the particular implementation, but they are
		usually sent with an exponential backoff.
		<br><br>
		The usual case of a TCP frozen window is that the application on the
		receiving side is not taking data from the TCP receive buffer quickly
		enough.

		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Send less data.
		<br>2) Have the receiving application retrieve the data more quickly; if the application cannot
		process all the data at once, consider storing the data in another buffer.
		<br>3) Upgrade the receiving computer.
		
		<h3>
			<a NAME="tcp_nagles"></a>TCP Nagle's Algorithm Bottleneck</h3>
		<h4>
			Diagnosis</h4>
		Nagle's algorithm is present and is slowing application response times.

		<h4>
			Explanation</h4>
		Nagle's algorithm is a sending-side algorithm that reduces the number
		of small packets on the network, thereby increasing router efficiency.
		Nagle's algorithm is causing excessive numbers of delayed ACKs and is
		slowing down the application.

		<h4>
			Suggestions</h4>
		1) Disable Nagle's algorithm for this application.<br>
		2) Rewrite the application such that it sends fewer, larger packets, or does not encounter a TCP delayed ACK.<br>
		3) Configure TCP on the receiving host so that TCP acknowledges every packet it receives.
